# No Waste
No Waste is an app that allows you to scan a QR code of your favorite restaurant's menu and see a virtual reality version of your food right in front of you.
This app will allow us to cut down on food waste by seeing the final product of your food before purchase, and helping you decide if you actually need to buy that much food.

# Installation
